Instructions for running the squential solver

5- inside bioFilm3_run/Sequential directory, type bioFilm3. For example
	[abdelshafy.k@discovery4 Sequential]$ bioFilm3 

6- The program will start to execute. The program will automatically create folders with names 5 and 10 and 15 and 20 â€¦ 300 . which contain the simulation results at different times. The run time is 6 hours approximately.

7- if you don't want to wait until the program finish execution, you can stop the program running at any time and you will get partial results. For example, if you stoped the program after 1 hour, you will get the results from t=0 to t=300/6=50

7- to show the simulation results with graphical user interface, type paraFoam. For example:
	[abdelshafy.k@discovery4 Sequential]$ paraFoam
