# BioFilm_HPC

The project is divided into two part. The first part is the code (solver) which should be compiled. The solver is located inside bioFilm3_solver. The second part is the data which the solver runs on which located inside bioFilm3_run.

A- Sequential code.
A-1. Compile the sequential solver first by reading the README file inside bioFilm3_solver/Sequential.
A-2. Run the sequential solve on the data by reading the README file inside bioFilm3_run/Sequential.

B- First Parallel code.
B-1. There is no new solver to be compiled for this case. WE will use the same sequential solve compiled in step A-1 above.
B-2 to run the first parallel version, read the file README inside bioFilm3_run/Firts_Parallel.
